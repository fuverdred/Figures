All of the python scripts I used to make simulated figures in my thesis.

1. uniform_isothermal_analysis.py

Shows how the error in fitting log-linear isothermal experiments varies with
sample size N. Shows that fitting a straight line to a log-linear plot yields
a smaller error than fitting an exponential decay, as long as only ~95%
of the sample is fitted
